A simple game written in Java and using the LWJGL for drawing.

This was going to to have circles instead of the squares.
However, I suck at using the LWJGL so that will have to wait.
This game is not finished and may never be.

You will need the lwjgl natives and lwjgl binary for your system to run this.
